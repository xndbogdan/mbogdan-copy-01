My name is Mo»ôteanu Bogdan-Mihai.

I'm an independent full-stack developer from Bucharest, Romania

My most useful collaboration was working with [Artgames](http://artgames.ro/), where I worked on the [Artmark](https://artmark.ro) website - a platform for online auctions, and [Art Safari](https://tickets.artsafari.ro/e) - a platform for selling tickets to the Art Safari events.

Now I am an independent contractor, looking for challenging projects.

Passionate about finding solutions to problems you didn't even know you had.
