My name is Mo»ôteanu Bogdan-Mihai, and I live in Bucharest, Romania.

I've always been interested in software development, and in computers in general.

My first IT job was as a web developer, using ASP.NET. I was involved in the development of ExeSoftware's [esFields ](https://www.exesoftware.ro/ro/produse/esfields/)application.

My first big project was Aftermath Studio, a music-making program. It received the gold medal at [Informatrix](https://infomatrix.ro/) in 2016 and is now Open Source, available [here](https://github.com/xndbogdan/AftermathStudio).

I also had other jobs working with PHP/Symfony and Java. 

My most useful collaboration was working with [Artgames](http://artgames.ro/), where I worked on the [Artmark](https://artmark.ro) website - a platform for online auctions, and [Art Safari](https://tickets.artsafari.ro/e) - a platform for selling tickets to the Art Safari events.

Now I am an independent contractor, looking to work on challenging projects.

**Other projects:**

[TrackerPro ](https://github.com/xndbogdan/TrackerPro)hiring challenge using Inertia.js.

[SChallenge ](https://github.com/xndbogdan/SChallenge)hiring challenge using Laravel Zero.

[Lambda ](https://github.com/xndbogdan/lambda-git)project using Spring.
